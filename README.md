# About Multi-Orientation MAXWELL
Multi-Orientation MAXWELL is a novel super-resolution application, designed for the tandem use of the X-ray light sheet microscope (MAXWELL) and super-resolution software (ThunderSTORM). This method utilizes the advanced 2D imaging capabilities of MAXWELL and the localization analysis from ThunderSTORM for the in-depth understanding of spatially isolated scintillating nanoparticles to build a precise 3D map of particle localization.
