# About 3DSTORM
3DSTORM is a novel super-resolution application, designed for the tandem use of the X-ray light sheet microscope (MAXWELL) and super-resolution software (ThunderSTORM). This method utilizes the advanced 2D imaging capabilities of MAXWELL and the localization analysis from ThunderSTORM for the in-depth understanding of spatially isolated scintillating nanoparticles and to build a precise 3D map of particle localization.

3DSTORM developed by Sierra Dean @ RIKEN SPring-8 Center (Japan) 2023
